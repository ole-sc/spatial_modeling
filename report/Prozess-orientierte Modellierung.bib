This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy {$\sigma$} is proportional to (Tc-T)32.The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.},

We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the processes by which organisms form groups and how social forces interact with environmental variability and transport. For aquatic organisms, the latter is especially important---will sheared or turbulent flows disrupt organism groups? To analyse such problems, we use individual-based models to study the environmental and social forces leading to grouping. The models are then embedded in turbulent flow fields to gain an understanding of the interplay between the forces acting on the individuals and the transport induced by the fluid motion. Instead of disruption of groups, we find that flows often enhance grouping by increasing the encounter rate among groups and thereby promoting merger into larger groups; the effect breaks down for strong flows. We discuss the transformation of individual-based models into continuum models for the density of organisms. A number of subtle difficulties arise in this process; however, we find that a direct comparison between the individual model and the continuum model is quite favorable. Finally, we examine the dynamics of group statistics and give an example of building an equation for the spatial and temporal variations of the group-size distribution from the individual-based simulations. These studies lay the groundwork for incorporating the effects of grouping into models of the large scale distributions of organisms as well as for examining the evolutionary consequences of group formation.},

Partial differential equation models provide a means of melding organism movement with population processes and have been used extensively to elucidate the effects of spatial variation on populations. While there has been an explosion of theoretical advances in partial differential equation models in the past two decades, this work has been generally neglected in mathematical ecology textbooks. Our goal in this paper is to make this literature accessible to experimentally ecologists. Partial differential equations are used to model a variety of ecological phenomena; here we discuss dispersal, ecological invasions, critical patch size, dispersal?mediated coexistence, and diffusion?driven spatial patterning. These model emphasize that simple organism movement can produce striking large?scale patterns in homogeneous environments, and that in heterogeneous environments, movement of multiple species can change the outcome of competition or predation.}

Yet, little is known about how different self-organizing processes operating at different spatial scales interact to determine ecosystem functioning. Here we show that the interplay between self-organizing processes at individual and ecosystem level is a key determinant of the functioning and resilience of mussel beds. In mussel beds, self-organization generates spatial patterns at two characteristic spatial scales: small-scale net-shaped patterns due to behavioural aggregation of individuals, and large-scale banded patterns due to the interplay of between-mussel facilitation and resource depletion. Model analysis reveals that the interaction between these behavioural and ecosystem-level mechanisms increases mussel bed resilience, enables persistence under deteriorating conditions and makes them less prone to catastrophic collapse. Our analysis highlights that interactions between different forms of self-organization at multiple spatial scales may enhance the intrinsic ability of ecosystems to withstand both natural and human-induced disturbances.},

Self-organized spatial patterns are important determinants of the functioning of ecosystems, promoting the growth and survival of the involved organisms, and affecting the capacity of the organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. The predominant explanation for self-organized pattern formation is spatial heterogeneity in establishment, growth and mortality, resulting from the self-organization processes. A number of recent studies, however, have revealed that movement of organisms can be an important driving process creating extensive spatial patterning in many ecosystems. Here, we review studies that detail movement-based pattern formation in contrasting ecological settings. Our review highlights that a common principle, where movement of organisms is density-dependent, explains observed spatial regular patterns in all of these studies. This principle, well known to physics as the Cahn--Hilliard principle of phase separation, has so-far remained unrecognized as a general mechanism for self-organized complexity in ecology. Using the examples presented in this paper, we explain how this movement principle can be discerned in ecological settings, and clarify how to test this mechanism experimentally. Our study highlights that animal movement, both in isolation and in unison with other processes, is an important mechanism for regular pattern formation in ecosystems.},

Turing's activator--inhibitor principle is considered the central paradigm to explain such patterns. According to this principle, local activation combined with long-range inhibition of growth and survival is an essential prerequisite for pattern formation. Here, we show that the physical principle of phase separation, solely based on density-dependent movement by organisms, represents an alternative class of self-organized pattern formation in ecology. Using experiments with self-organizing mussel beds, we derive an empirical relation between the speed of animal movement and local animal density. By incorporating this relation in a partial differential equation, we demonstrate that this model corresponds mathematically to the well-known Cahn--Hilliard equation for phase separation in physics. Finally, we show that the predicted patterns match those found both in field observations and in our experiments. Our results reveal a principle for ecological self-organization, where phase separation rather than activation and inhibition processes drives spatial pattern formation.},

We show quantitatively how repulsion must dominate attraction (Rrd+1{$>$}cAad+1where R, A are magnitudes, c is a constant of order 1, and d is the space dimension) to avoid collapse of the group to a tight cluster. We also verify the existence of a well-spaced locally stable state, having a characteristic individual distance. When the number of individuals in a group increases, a dichotomy occurs between swarms in which individual distance is preserved versus those in which the physical size of the group is maintained at the expense of greater crowding.},

The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered. Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's (t), and various landscape ecology metrics. Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques.},

  abstract = {Resilience to tipping points in ecosystems                            Spatial pattern formation has been proposed as an early warning signal for dangerous tipping points and imminent critical transitions in complex systems, including ecosystems. Rietkerk               et al               . review how ecosystems and Earth system components can actually evade catastrophic tipping through various pathways of spatial pattern formation. With mathematical and real-world examples, they argue that evading tipping and enhancing resilience could be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that until now were known as tipping prone. Many of these complex systems may be more resilient than currently thought because of overlooked spatial dynamics and multiple stable states, and may thus not undergo critical or catastrophic transitions with global change. ---AMS                        ,              A review explains that resilience to tipping points in ecological systems can be conferred by spatial pattern formation.           ,                             BACKGROUND               In the Anthropocene, there is a need to better understand the catastrophic effects that climate and land-use change may have on ecosystems, Earth system components, and the whole Earth system. The concept of critical transitions, or tipping from one state to another, contributes to this understanding. Tipping occurs in a system when it is forced outside the basin of attraction of the original equilibrium, resulting in a critical transition to an alternative, often less-desirable, stable state. In this context, the search for early warning signals for such imminent critical transitions has become a focus of research. In particular, spatial self-organization in ecosystems, such as the spontaneous formation of regular vegetation patterns---so-called Turing patterns---has been suggested as a prominent early warning signal.                                         ADVANCES               However, recent findings indicate that such spatial self-organization should not necessarily be interpreted as an early warning signal for critical transitions. Instead, spatial self-organization can cause ecosystems to evade tipping points and can thereby be a signal of resilience. These findings are based on recent mathematical analyses of spatial models and on observations of real ecosystems. Both have revealed multistability, meaning that many different spatial patterns can co-occur under the same environmental conditions, and each of these patterns can stay stable for a wide range of conditions. This enables complex system states to persist beyond tipping points through spatial self-organization. Moreover, if a complex system with tipping properties experiences a perturbation, subsequent change of the system does not necessarily lead to tipping of the complete system. Instead, the change can stay localized because the system allows for alternative states to coexist in space---thus referred to as coexistence states. These spatial patterns can also persist beyond tipping points with worsening conditions through this alternative pathway. We refer to both Turing patterns and coexistence states as spatial pattern formation. Evasion of tipping through these various pathways of spatial pattern formation may be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that were hitherto interpreted as prone to tipping, including for Earth as a whole.                                         OUTLOOK               To further study how complex systems evade tipping through spatial pattern formation, savanna ecosystems can be considered as a concrete archetypal example because of the alternative states and spatial patterns observed for them. Moreover, universal conditions for evading tipping points in both ecosystems and Earth system components can be derived by mathematical analyses. Scenarios can be revealed by which Turing patterns with small amplitudes can grow and form large-scale localized interacting structures, thereby aiding complex systems to evade tipping. The effects that global change has on the spatial boundaries between coexistence states should be studied, and the impacts of restrictions of spatial domain and localized and nonlocal homogenizing effects by humans should be revealed. This approach will advance our understanding and predictions of critical transitions in nature and reveal how these may be avoided or reversed.                                                   Evasion of tipping points.                                        We illustrate the response of complex systems to changes in external conditions (i.e., a bifurcation diagram). Homogeneous dark gray squares depict high density of the system state variable, and homogeneous light gray squares illustrate low density. (                     A                     ) Classic view.

Recent model analysis has revealed multistability of Turing patterns in Busse balloons, supported by satellite observations of real ecosystems. A Busse balloon is the region in parameter space in mathematical models where multistability of patterned equilibria occurs.

These spatial patterns originate in the bistability region before the tipping point; the evolving spatial patterns can also persist beyond the tipping point with worsening external conditions, thereby constituting an alternative pathway to evade tipping points.                                                                                            ,              The concept of tipping points and critical transitions helps inform our understanding of the catastrophic effects that global change may have on ecosystems, Earth system components, and the whole Earth system. The search for early warning indicators is ongoing, and spatial self-organization has been interpreted as one such signal. Here, we review how spatial self-organization can aid complex systems to evade tipping points and can therefore be a signal of resilience instead. Evading tipping points through various pathways of spatial pattern formation may be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that hitherto have been identified as tipping prone, including for the entire Earth system. We propose a systematic analysis that may reveal the broad range of conditions under which tipping is evaded and resilience emerges.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on               Hydra               and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

  abstract = {Spatial self-organization is the main theoretical explanation for the global occurrence of regular or otherwise coherent spatial patterns in ecosystems. Using mussel beds as a model ecosystem, we provide an experimental demonstration of spatial self-organization. Under homogeneous laboratory conditions, mussels developed regular patterns, similar to those in the field. An individual-based model derived from our experiments showed that interactions between individuals explained the observed patterns. Furthermore, a field study showed that pattern formation affected ecosystem-level processes in terms of improved growth and resistance to wave action. Our results imply that spatial self-organization is an important determinant of the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and it needs to be considered in their conservation.},

  abstract = {A large number of methods for the analysis of point pattern data have been developed in a wide range of scientific fields. First-order statistics describe large-scale variation in the intensity of points in a study region, whereas second-order characteristics are summary statistics of all point-to-point distances in a mapped area and offer the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns. Second-order analysis based on Ripley's K-function is increasingly used in ecology to characterize spatial patterns and to develop hypothesis on underlying processes; however, the full range of available methods has seldomly been applied by ecologists. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in second-order analysis to help in the choice of appropriate methods and to point to practical difficulties and pitfalls. We review (1) methods for analytical and numerical implementation of two complementary second-order statistics, Ripley's K and the O-ring statistic, (2) methods for edge correction, (3) methods to account for first-order effects (i.e. heterogeneity) of univariate patterns, and (4) a variety of useful standard and non-standard null models for univariate and bivariate patterns. For illustrative purpose, we analyze examples that deal with non-homogeneous univariate point patterns. We demonstrate that large-scale heterogeneity of a point-pattern biases Ripley's K-function at smaller scales. This bias is difficult to detect without explicitly testing for homogeneity, but we show that it can be removed when applying methods that account for first-order effects. We synthesize our review in a number of step-by-step recommendations that guide the reader through the selection of appropriate methods and we provide a software program that implements most of the methods reviewed and developed here.},

  abstract = {Patterns are pervasive in nature with many examples being found in both living and inanimate systems. While researchers recognize the importance of the behavior of individuals to the structure and shape of an aggregation, a major hurdle in describing aggregated organisms has been the difficulty of tracking the movement of individuals over time. Here we present an innovative application of an analytical technique derived from statistical mechanics (a subfield of physics) to describe the spatial distribution of grouped organisms. Radial distribution and pair-correlation functions are traditionally used by physicists to describe inert particle dynamics. This novel biological application allows one to infer the behavioral characteristics of individuals within a group based solely on the spatial distribution of the aggregate population. Additionally, the method allows one to determine the correlation length, the average maximum distance over which one individual may exert an influence on another member of the aggregation. The analytical technique presented here is also important in that it minimizes two problems that typically plague studies of grouped organisms: it eliminates the need to track the movements of individuals, and it partially takes into account the presence of occluded individuals. This technique also permits quantitative comparison between aggregations formed under various environmental and/or experimental conditions. Thus, this technique may be of value to resource managers, ecologists, and others working with grouped organisms (e.g., plankton swarms, schooling fish, flocking birds, or migratory mammals) who seek to gain information about factors influencing the structure and behavior of such groups.},
