  abstract = {We consider and compare four approaches to modeling the dynamics of spatially distributed systems: mean field approaches (described by ordinary differential equations) in which every individual is considered to have equal probability of interacting with every other individual; patch models that group discrete individuals into patches without additional spatial structure; reaction-diffusion equations, in which infinitesimal individuals are distributed in space; and interacting particle systems, in which individuals are discrete and space is treated explicitly. We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations.},

  abstract = {Self-organized complexity at multiple spatial scales is a distinctive characteristic of biological systems. Yet, little is known about how different self-organizing processes operating at different spatial scales interact to determine ecosystem functioning. Here we show that the interplay between self-organizing processes at individual and ecosystem level is a key determinant of the functioning and resilience of mussel beds. In mussel beds, self-organization generates spatial patterns at two characteristic spatial scales: small-scale net-shaped patterns due to behavioural aggregation of individuals, and large-scale banded patterns due to the interplay of between-mussel facilitation and resource depletion. Model analysis reveals that the interaction between these behavioural and ecosystem-level mechanisms increases mussel bed resilience, enables persistence under deteriorating conditions and makes them less prone to catastrophic collapse. Our analysis highlights that interactions between different forms of self-organization at multiple spatial scales may enhance the intrinsic ability of ecosystems to withstand both natural and human-induced disturbances.},

  abstract = {Many ecosystems develop strikingly regular spatial patterns because of small-scale interactions between organisms, a process generally referred to as spatial self-organization. Self-organized spatial patterns are important determinants of the functioning of ecosystems, promoting the growth and survival of the involved organisms, and affecting the capacity of the organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. The predominant explanation for self-organized pattern formation is spatial heterogeneity in establishment, growth and mortality, resulting from the self-organization processes. A number of recent studies, however, have revealed that movement of organisms can be an important driving process creating extensive spatial patterning in many ecosystems. Here, we review studies that detail movement-based pattern formation in contrasting ecological settings. Our review highlights that a common principle, where movement of organisms is density-dependent, explains observed spatial regular patterns in all of these studies. This principle, well known to physics as the Cahn--Hilliard principle of phase separation, has so-far remained unrecognized as a general mechanism for self-organized complexity in ecology. Using the examples presented in this paper, we explain how this movement principle can be discerned in ecological settings, and clarify how to test this mechanism experimentally. Our study highlights that animal movement, both in isolation and in unison with other processes, is an important mechanism for regular pattern formation in ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The origin of regular spatial patterns in ecological systems has long fascinated researchers. Turing's activator--inhibitor principle is considered the central paradigm to explain such patterns. According to this principle, local activation combined with long-range inhibition of growth and survival is an essential prerequisite for pattern formation. Here, we show that the physical principle of phase separation, solely based on density-dependent movement by organisms, represents an alternative class of self-organized pattern formation in ecology. Using experiments with self-organizing mussel beds, we derive an empirical relation between the speed of animal movement and local animal density. By incorporating this relation in a partial differential equation, we demonstrate that this model corresponds mathematically to the well-known Cahn--Hilliard equation for phase separation in physics. Finally, we show that the predicted patterns match those found both in field observations and in our experiments. Our results reveal a principle for ecological self-organization, where phase separation rather than activation and inhibition processes drives spatial pattern formation.},

The purpose of this review is to discuss some of the evidence for fractal geometry in experimental systems and indicate how fractal geometry can be used to develop a better understanding of their aggregation kinetics and physical properties. At the present time much of our understanding of the structure and properties of fractal aggregates has come from computer simulations. Consequently, a major part of this paper is concerned with the role played by simple computer models in understanding the origins of fractal aggregates as well as their physical and chemical properties. The main emphasis is on models for colloidal aggregation but a brief description of a few other models for non-equilibrium growth and aggregation processes which have been of particular interest during the past few years has been included.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on               Hydra               and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

Using mussel beds as a model ecosystem, we provide an experimental demonstration of spatial self-organization. Under homogeneous laboratory conditions, mussels developed regular patterns, similar to those in the field. An individual-based model derived from our experiments showed that interactions between individuals explained the observed patterns. Furthermore, a field study showed that pattern formation affected ecosystem-level processes in terms of improved growth and resistance to wave action. Our results imply that spatial self-organization is an important determinant of the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and it needs to be considered in their conservation.},

  abstract = {Patterns are pervasive in nature with many examples being found in both living and inanimate systems. While researchers recognize the importance of the behavior of individuals to the structure and shape of an aggregation, a major hurdle in describing aggregated organisms has been the difficulty of tracking the movement of individuals over time. Here we present an innovative application of an analytical technique derived from statistical mechanics (a subfield of physics) to describe the spatial distribution of grouped organisms. Radial distribution and pair-correlation functions are traditionally used by physicists to describe inert particle dynamics. This novel biological application allows one to infer the behavioral characteristics of individuals within a group based solely on the spatial distribution of the aggregate population. Additionally, the method allows one to determine the correlation length, the average maximum distance over which one individual may exert an influence on another member of the aggregation. The analytical technique presented here is also important in that it minimizes two problems that typically plague studies of grouped organisms: it eliminates the need to track the movements of individuals, and it partially takes into account the presence of occluded individuals. This technique also permits quantitative comparison between aggregations formed under various environmental and/or experimental conditions. Thus, this technique may be of value to resource managers, ecologists, and others working with grouped organisms (e.g., plankton swarms, schooling fish, flocking birds, or migratory mammals) who seek to gain information about factors influencing the structure and behavior of such groups.},
